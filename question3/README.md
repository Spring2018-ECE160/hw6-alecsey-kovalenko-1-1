## Question 2

(K&R Exercise 5-14 & 5-15) Modify the sort program to handle a -r flag, which indicates sorting in reverse (decreasing) order. Be sure that -r works with -n.

Also, add the option -f to fold upper and lower case together, so that case distinctions are not made during sorting; for example, a and A compare equal.

Compile Steps:

gcc hw6q3.c -o hw6q3.exe

Output:

ex. ./hw6q3.exe -r < sort.c

n: 0, r: 1, f: 0
